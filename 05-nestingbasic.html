  <h1>Nesting basics using lists as examples</h1>

  <h2>Reporting sources: An "unordered list" with 1 level of nesting:</h2>

    <ul>
          <li>Online news and databases</li>
          <li>Available documents and public records</li>
          <li>Human sources
          <li>FOIA/FOIL requests</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Reporting sources: An "unordered list" with a second level of nesting:</h2>

    <ul>
          <li>Online news and databases</li>
          <li>Available documents and public records</li>
          <li>Human sources:
            <ul>
              <li>Victims</li>
              <li>Public officials</li>
              <li>Experts</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          <li>FOIA/FOIL requests</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Why use FOIA/FOIL laws for reporting (an "ordered list")</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>It is your citizen’s right to access public records and any other form of public information</li>
      <li>Give readers the info they need to exercise their political power</li>
      <li>Shine a light on corruption, inefficiency and incompetency</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>What is FOIA/FOIL: A "definition list"</h2>

    <dl>
      <dt>Federal FOIA and FOIL (state) laws</dt>
        <dd>Are the laws that protect your right to request information from federal, state and city agencies</dd>

      <dt>FOIA</dt>
        <dd>Applies to federal executive branch agencies. Does not apply to any other level of government</dd>

      <dt>FOIL (state)</dt>
        <dd>Not all FOIL are born equal. Every State has its own law</dd>

      <dt>Exceptions:</dt>
        <dd><li>FOIA: national security, internal agency rules, statutory exemption, trade secrets (sometimes an excuse to not give you database model layouts), inter-agency or intra-agency memos, personal privacy, some law enforcement records and other.</li></dd>
        <dd><li>FOIL in NY State (each state is it’s own thing): similar to FOIA in 11 categories, including contract awards or collective bargaining negotiations</li></dd>
