<p>Each HTML tag means something. For example p stands for paragraph and
h1 stands for headline level 1 and h2 is for a headline level 2</p>

<h1>This is a Headline level 1</h1>

<h2>This is a Headline level 2</h2>

<p>This is a paragraph</p>

<p>Tags most often come in pairs</p>

<p>There are "self enclosing" tags, like <br> for example which produces a line break. They don't need tag</p>

<p>Everything between an opening tag and a closing tag is called an HTML element</p>
