    <h1>Accuracy checklist (in a table)</h1>
    <h4>By <a href="https://github.com/mattwaite/AccuracyChecklist/blob/master/accuracy_checklist.md" target=“_blank”><i>Matt Waite</i></a>)</h4>
    <p>The first job of a reporter is to get it right. It's a simple concept, and very easy to screw it up. To get miles ahead, use this simple checklist.</p>

    <h3>While reporting</h3>

      <table>
        <tr>
           <td><strong>Status</strong></td>
           <td><strong>Item</strong></td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
           <td>[ ]</td>
           <td>Ask sources to spell their names, first and last.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
           <td>[ ]</td>
           <td>Ask sources to spell their full title.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
           <td>[ ]</td>
           <td>Ask sources for the source of any numbers cited.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
           <td>[ ]</td>
           <td>Ask sources for documentation on facts cited to support an argument.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
           <td>[ ]</td>
           <td>If the story is ongoing, ask what others have incorrectly reported.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>


  <h3>While writing</h3>

  <p>Make a digital copy of your story and highlight every fact in the story, putting a checkmark next to every verified item after checking it.</p>

    <table>

      <tr>
         <td><strong>Status</strong></td>
         <td><strong>Item</strong></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Verify spelling of each proper noun.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Verify titles of sources with your notes and/or online staff directories at their employer.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Double check any calculations done in the story.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Compare any number used in the story to the original source of that number.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Verify correct AP style on all addresses.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Verify correct AP style on all numbers.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Compare quotes to notes or interview transcripts.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Verify quotes and paraphrases are properly and correctly attributed.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>If you use a phone number in a story, call it to be sure it works and is correct.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Read each word slowly and carefully to ensure it's the correct word. Spellcheck will not catch you spelling the wrong word correctly.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
         <td>[ ]</td>
         <td>Read the story out loud to find rough sentences or missing words.</td>
      </tr>
